# daRt

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->
The daRt package provides a very quick and flexible way to import data that is produced by the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. The data in daRt are formatted in a way that facilitates rapid data analysis. 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("willmorrison1/daRt")
```
## Example
Load the package
```{r load the package}
library(daRt)
```
Create and modify the “SimulationFilter” object. This object describes what data you want to extract from a DART output directory structure.
```{r simulationFilter example}
#define SimulationFilter object - define "directions" as the product
sF <- simulationFilter(product = "directions")

#show the SimulationFilter
sF

#list the 'setters' and 'accessors'
methods(class = "SimulationFilter")

#e.g. change the 'bands', then the 'iterations'
bands(sF) <- c("BAND0", "BAND1")
iters(sF) <- "ITER1"
```
Now explore the DART output directory structure. First define the simulation directory. For this example, 'simulationDir' is a relative directory and is one simulation.
```{r get files example}
simulationDir <- "man/data/cesbio"
```
If you install the package using devtools::install_github then these DART files will not be available automatically. To use these files, get them from github manually or use your own 'cesbio' simulation (is shipped with the DART model). 

The directory should be the base directory of the simulation. E.g. within 'simulationDir there should be the simulation 'input' and 'output' directories.
```{r inout example}
list.files(simulationDir)
```
Now we have the simulation diretory clarified, we continue by defining a simulationFilter and then
explore the files
```{r files getFiles example}
#define the SimulationFiler as shown above (i.e. 'sF'), but in one line
sF1 <- simulationFilter(product = "directions", 
                       bands = c("BAND0", "BAND1"), 
                       iters = "ITER1")

#get simulation files based on this newly defined filter
simFiles <- daRt::getFiles(x = simulationDir, sF = sF1)

#show these files are we happy to continue and load the data, or
#do we want to adjust the SimulationFilter? daRt::getFiles is essentially
#a 'dry-run' of the data extraction
files(simFiles)
```
Now extract DART output data
```{r get data example}
#get simulation data
simData <- daRt::getData(x = simulationDir, sF = sF1)
```
Documentation needs updating and finishing from here
```{r plot data example}
#plot using ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
plotOut <- ggplot(simData@data) +
    geom_point(aes(x = zenith, y = value, colour = azimuth)) +
    facet_wrap(~ band) +
    theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
plot(plotOut)
```
Then alter the SimulationFilter to look at images
```{r images example}
product(sF) <- "images"
simData <- daRt::getData(x = simulationDir, sF = sF)
ggplot(simData@data) + 
    geom_raster(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value)) +
    facet_grid(band ~ imageNo) +
    theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```
Alter the SimulationFilter again to now look at radiative budget files
```{r RB3D example}
product(sF) <- "rb3D"
simData <- daRt::getData(x = simulationDir, sF = sF)
```
The 3D radiative budget data are stored with the X, Y and Z location fo each cell stored in 3 columns
```{r RB3D data example}
head(simData@data)
```

Now plot the a slice of the radiative budget data
```{r RB3D plot example}
ggplot(simData@data) + 
    geom_raster(aes(x = X, y = Y, fill = value)) +
    facet_grid(band + variablesRB3D~ Z) +
    theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```
That's a lot of data! It is important to set the "SimulationFilter" to match what data you want so that this doesn't happen. Also, the process can use a lot of memory when many large files are loaded so try to only load in the files you need in the first place.
The below example uses the simple "dplyr" approach to work with the data. Here we look at the lowest horizontal layer of each 3D radiative budget array (i.e. Z = 1) rather than all layers (above plot) and plot the smaller dataset.
```{r RB3D filter}
library(dplyr)
simData_filtered <- simData@data %>%
    dplyr::filter(Z == 1)
#plot again and tweak the plot
ggplot(simData_filtered) + 
    geom_raster(aes(x = X, y = Y, fill = value)) +
    facet_grid(band ~ variablesRB3D) +
    theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.spacing = unit(0, "cm"), 
          strip.text = element_text(size = 6, 
                                    margin = margin(0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, unit = "cm"))) +
    scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Spectral")
```
